/* functions from ODIN - getComputerChoice
playRound function with 2 parameters - playerSelection and computerSelection
 ^^ should return a STRING that declares the winner in "You Lose! Paper beats Rock." format
game() function that contains the playRound function - meat and potatoes of the script.

needs to read button selection from user - when button is pressed, also randomizes CPU selection
change images of user selection to what user selected - do the same for CPU
change instructions/win condition text to the round results
first to 5 - displays a "play again" after either user/cpu wins + wipes scores and resets placeholder images
account for ties? going to have to at some point in all of this
